# FreshMac

## Overview

Copy of a script I use to setup CLI on macOS along with setup instructions and config files.  This repo was originally developed for bash but is now natively used for zsh(bash should still work and will continue to get supported)

## BrewOnly.sh



run the script locally using:

```  
$ bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fibnumb/FreshMac/master/Setup.sh) 
```



## bash_profile.mine zshrc.mine

bash and zsh setup scripts with aliases

## Post installation

After installation I have a couple of things I like to add.

1) Install fig
	www.fig.io

2) Install the following hyper terminal packages 

	hyper-opacity
	hyperborder
	hyperterm-hipster
